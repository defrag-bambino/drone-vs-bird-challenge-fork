The drone-vs-birds challenge aims at meauring and driving progress in the automated detection of small drones in image data.
A focus of the challenge is differentiation between drones and birds, particularly at far distances.
Our dataset is continually increased over consecutive installments of the challenge and made available for reasearch purposes to the community afterwards.
